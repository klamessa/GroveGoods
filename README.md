GroveGoods - Your Root to a Greener Tomorrow

We welcome your contributions!

While in an energy course we began our journey with a shared realization of the profound impact trees have on energy conservation within residential areas. Moved by this, we set out to create a community centered platform solution.

**About Project**
GroveGoods is a tree-selling website, It's also a commitment to a greener, more sustainable future. Our user-friendly website is designed to help you find the perfect tree for your space, whether it's for beauty, shade, or to reduce your energy footprint. With five types of trees available — each with its unique benefits and beauty — we offer options for every tree enthusiast, and our selection is always growing.

**Front-end: ** Through HTML structured by Pug templates, we've built a seamless and engaging user interface. Our styling, defined in CSS, adapts to your device and even includes a dark mode to suit your viewing preferences.

**Back-end:** Powered by Node.js, our server.js file is the backbone of the site, ensuring a smooth and secure experience. We handle data with care, bringing you an interactive and responsive journey from browsing to checkout.


We invite you to explore our site and contribute.
